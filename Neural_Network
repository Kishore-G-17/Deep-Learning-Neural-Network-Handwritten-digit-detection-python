Topic: Neural network and keras

Neural network:
-> It is a network of neurons.
-> Neuron: It has mainly two parts namely 'linear eqn' and 'activate fn(sigmoid)'
-> sigmoid fn: The mathematical function to convert the value between 0 and 1.
-> Generally, A neural network has 3 layers namely Input layer, Hidden layer, Output layer.
-> keras: It is basically a wrapper for tensorflow that will give the useful API's to use.

Important points to remember in the below task:
-> Inorder to view the 2D handwritten image using matshow() function in matplotlib.pyplot module.
   You will need the argument in the 2D array format.
   
Task:
-> Task name: Neural network for handwritten digit detection.
